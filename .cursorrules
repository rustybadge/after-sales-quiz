## Project
- App: After-Sales Quiz (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind).
- Purpose: quick diagnostic + maturity-aware recommendations for after-sales teams.
- Primary file: `src/AfterSalesQuiz.tsx` (questions, weights, scoring, recommendations).

## What to optimize (source of truth)
- Recommendations must be maturity-aware:
  - Show **Quick wins** only for categories below thresholds.
  - If no weak spots, show **Next-horizon plays** (advanced actions).
  - If no meaningful headroom (â‰¤5 pts to 100 in all categories), show **Maintain & monitor**.
- Keep UI minimal, no new dependencies, no CSS libs beyond Tailwind.
- Plain-English copy, concise.

## Constraints
- TypeScript functional components.
- Do not change build tooling or Tailwind config.
- Prefer changes isolated to `src/AfterSalesQuiz.tsx`. Touch `src/App.tsx` only if absolutely necessary.

## Style
- Scandinavian minimalism. Clear headings, short sentences. Avoid buzzwords.
